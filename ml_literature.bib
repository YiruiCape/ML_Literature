  abstract = {We explore an original strategy for building deep networks,based on stacking layers of denoising autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resultingalgorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking ofordinary autoencoders.  It is howevershown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error,thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks(DBN), and in several cases surpass-ing it.  Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost theperformance of subsequent SVM classifiers.  Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordi-nary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from naturalimage patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the valueof using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of usefulhigher level representations},
